Experiment with different speeds to achieve various effects. Shooting faster freezes motion, while shooting slower creates a sense of motion blur. You can also use an ND filter, which acts like sunglasses for your camera, allowing for even slower shutter speeds. This technique helped me achieve the smooth effect in this photo.","tags":["CameraType|Digital","Category|Nature","ContentType|snapshot","Gallery|2019","Location|Iceland","PhotographyPortfolioV2|Iceland","cameracoffeewander|Camera|NikonD5300","cameracoffeewander|PhotoType|Landscape","cameracoffeewander|Place|Iceland|Country","cameracoffeewander|Special|NatGeoYourShot","cameracoffeewander|Special|PhotographyTips"],"id":"a27c9489-f3a7-5bdc-ae45-050abea3aa73","galleryIds":["iceland"]},"cf1a4ce5-301a-5450-a1e1-df1c63ea1ed7":{"src":"DSC_1494.jpg","camera":"Nikon Z5","lens":"NIKKOR Z 24-120mm f/4 S","iso":"ISO 1600","shutterSpeed":"13s","aperture":"ƒ/7.1","focalLength":"34.5mm","dateTaken":"February 2023","title":"Moonrise over Baja","description":"We were sitting on the beach watching the sunset.

my van, enjoying a campfire, a storm started to roll in.

Expose it a stop or two darker than what looks good - the lightening is going to brighten things up. If your camera has a built in interval feature - use it. Don't forget, stay safe out there!","tags":["PhotographyPortfolioV2|Montana","cameracoffeewander|Camera|NikonZ5","cameracoffeewander|PhotoType|Storms","cameracoffeewander|Place|USA|Montana|State","cameracoffeewander|Special|NatGeoYourShot"],"id":"c8930f01-67c4-53bb-b0b4-6a9b7af87b45","galleryIds":["montana"]}}}
